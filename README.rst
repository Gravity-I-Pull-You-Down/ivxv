----------
 Building
----------

Building the collector components requires Go 1.7 and the management
applications require Java 8.

The code is tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Xenial Xerus. However, it does not have
Go 1.7 packaged for it, so to install the required compilers, do

::

        cat <<HERE | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yakkety-universe.list > /dev/null
        deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu yakkety universe
        deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu yakkety-updates universe
        deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu yakkety-security universe
        HERE

        cat <<HERE | sudo tee /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99default-release > /dev/null
        APT::Default-Release "xenial";
        HERE

        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends openjdk-8-jdk-headless golang-1.7-go

This will add the Ubuntu 16.10 Yakkety Yak repository as an additional source,
but mark Xenial as the default release, so packages will be installed from it
only if they are not available in the Xenial repository.

        *Note!* Go 1.7 is only required for buildingâ€”the servers that will
        be running collector services do not need to perform these steps!

Next, external dependencies need to be acquired. See
`common/external/README.rst` for instructions on this.

Finally, to build, test, and clean the entire codebase, just do

::

        make
        make test
        make clean

Individual components can be built, tested, and cleaned with

::

        make <component>
        make test-<component>
        make clean-<component>

where ``<component>`` is the name name of the components subdirectory.

All components are built in release mode by default. To build in development
mode, which enables dummy modules and other components not safe for release,
the make variable ``DEVELOPMENT`` must be set either on the command line or in
the environment. Every target of the root Makefile can be called with a
``-dev`` suffix, which sets this variable during the make.

Debian packages can be built using ``dpkg-buildpackage`` (or ``debuild`` if
preferred) as usual.

 Development

Setting GOPATH
--------------

The IVXV project uses multiple GOPATH directories, one for each Go component.
During ``make`` commands, the GOPATH will be automatically set, but if a
developer (or their IDE) wishes to run some manual Go commands, then this can
be tedious to specify. To help with this

::

        make gopath

will print out the GOPATH used by the build system. So for example, when using
Bash,

::

        export GOPATH="$(make gopath)"

will set the correct GOPATH in the current shell.
